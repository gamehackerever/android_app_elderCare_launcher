## **Project Structure**

### **MainActivity (Home Screen and App Launcher)**

This is the **main home screen** of the app. It consists of the following components:
- **Emergency SOS Button**: Sends location via SMS to selected contacts when pressed.
- **Basic Apps**: Large clickable buttons for quick access to camera, gallery, calendar, flashlight, YouTube, Chrome, Google Maps, phone, etc.

### **LocationPickerActivity (Location Picker for Emergencies)**

This activity allows users to select their **emergency location** via a map:
- **GPS Location** is fetched and shown on a map.
- **Manual selection** of the location using OpenStreetMap is available.
- The selected location is saved for use in sending emergency SMS alerts.

### **ContactsAdapter (Adapter for Emergency Contacts)**

Displays and manages a list of emergency contacts using a **RecyclerView**. Users can:
- Add contacts from their phone book.
- Delete contacts.
- View contact information.

### **Location and Contact Management**

- **Location** and **contacts** are saved in **SharedPreferences**, ensuring persistent data even after the app is closed.

### **Messaging (Sending SMS during SOS)**

Upon pressing the **SOS button**, the app fetches the user's current **GPS location** and sends an **SMS** with the coordinates to all selected emergency contacts.

- Android 5.0 (Lollipop) or higher.
- **Android Studio** with the **Android SDK** (minimum version 30).

## **Issues Faced & Solutions**

### **1. Issue: SMS sending failed**
**Problem:** Initially, the SMS sending feature was not functioning due to a permission issue with sending SMS messages on certain devices.

**Solution:** 
- Ensured the `SEND_SMS` permission was added to the **AndroidManifest.xml**.
- Added runtime permission request logic for sending SMS messages.

### **2. Issue: GPS location fetching was unreliable**
**Problem:** On some devices, fetching the current GPS location failed intermittently, particularly in locations with weak signal or when there was a delay in obtaining location services.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented a fallback location (a default latitude and longitude) in case the location could not be fetched in a reasonable amount of time. This ensures the user still has a location to be sent in emergencies, even if the device cannot fetch the precise GPS location immediately.

### **3. Issue: Map interaction with ScrollView**
**Problem:** The map was in a **ScrollView**, which caused conflicts when interacting with the map (such as zooming or dragging the map).

**Solution:**
- Disabled the **parent ScrollView's** scroll behavior temporarily when the user touches the map to allow smooth interaction. This was done by calling `requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true)` on the parent view during map touch events.

### **4. Issue: Difficult navigation in large UI elements**
**Problem:** The design was initially cluttered and navigation was tough for elderly users, especially those with motor impairments.

**Solution:** 
- Simplified the interface to include **larger buttons** for critical apps like camera, flashlight, emergency contacts, and SOS button.
- The buttons were made more prominent and easy to access by focusing on **key, frequently used apps** and **features**.

### **5. Issue: Managing contacts from the phonebook**
**Problem:** Reading contacts from the device sometimes returned blank contact lists or crashed on specific Android versions due to the lack of necessary permissions.

**Solution:** 
- Added handling for **READ_CONTACTS** permission, requesting it at runtime.
- Used content providers to efficiently access and display contacts while gracefully handling errors where access was denied or contacts were unavailable.
